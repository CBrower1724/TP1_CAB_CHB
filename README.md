This is our repository regarding group project one where we analyzed data from the dataset Airline Passenger Satisfaction. Within this repository you will find the Jupyter Notebook, the word document with our analysis, the Tableau document, and the presentation made using Tableau features. This project was all about answering the questions, what categorical variables correlate with passenger satisfaction and can passenger satisfaction be predicted? Through our analysis shown in the word document using the Jupyter Notebook and Tableau we were able to answer the ultimate questions. Using different types of graphs and analyzing the data we found the answer to the main questions we were trying to figure out within the dataset.
